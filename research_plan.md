# Research Plan

My approach to evaluating open source AI models for student competence analysis would begin with a comprehensive landscape analysis of available tools. I would search through Hugging Face's model hub, GitHub repositories, and AI research papers to identify models specifically designed for code analysis or adaptable educational assessment. Key evaluation criteria would include: the model's ability to parse and understand Python syntax and semantics, its capacity for generating pedagogically appropriate prompts, computational requirements for deployment, license restrictions, and evidence of performance on similar tasks. I would prioritize models that demonstrate strong natural language understanding alongside code comprehension capabilities, such as instruction-tuned variants of code-specific LLMs.

For validation, I would develop a testing framework using a diverse set of student-generated Python code samples representing varying skill levels and common misconceptions. I would assess each model's outputs against three metrics: conceptual accuracy (whether prompts address legitimate programming concepts), pedagogical effectiveness (whether prompts guide without revealing solutions), and adaptability (ability to handle different problem types and student levels). The validation would involve both automated analysis and human evaluation by experienced Python educators who would rate the quality and appropriateness of generated prompts using a standardized rubric.

# Reasoning

**What makes a model suitable for high-level competence analysis?**
A suitable model must combine technical code analysis capabilities with pedagogical intelligence. It needs to understand not just syntax errors but conceptual misunderstandings, recognize partial solutions, and identify the specific knowledge gaps preventing progress. The model should be able to contextualize student code within learning progressions and generate prompts that scaffold understanding rather than simply correcting mistakes.

**How would you test whether a model generates meaningful prompts?**
I would use a multi-method approach: first, quantitative analysis using metrics like response relevance scoring and conceptual alignment measurements; second, qualitative assessment by educators rating prompts on clarity, appropriateness, and effectiveness; and third, classroom testing where generated prompts are used with actual students to measure learning outcomes and engagement compared to human-generated prompts.

**What trade-offs might exist between accuracy, interpretability, and cost?**
More accurate models typically require greater computational resources, increasing deployment costs. Highly complex models often sacrifice interpretability, making it difficult to understand why specific prompts are generated, which reduces teacher trust and ability to intervene appropriately. Smaller, more interpretable models may lack the nuance for high-quality analysis, creating a tension between practical deployability and analytical depth.

**Why did you choose the model you evaluated, and what are its strengths or limitations?**
I would evaluate CodeT5+ for its strong performance on code-related tasks and relatively manageable size. Its strengths include excellent code understanding capabilities, open weights, and good performance on instruction-following tasks. Limitations include potentially high computational requirements for real-time educational deployment, need for significant fine-tuning to optimize for educational contexts, and possible gaps in recognizing novice-specific misconceptions that differ from professional coding errors.
